  ==========================================================
                  4images Installation
           (Modernized Version with Tailwind CSS)
  ==========================================================

  ----------------------------------------------------------
  System Requirements:
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  - A webserver or web hosting account (Linux/Apache recommended).
  - PHP version 7.4 or higher (Recommended: PHP 8.1+, PHP 8.4 planned).
    To ensure that 4images is functioning properly, "safe_mode" should be disabled
    ("safe_mode = off" in your php.ini).
  - MySQL version 5.7+ or MariaDB 10.3+

  NEW in this modernized version:
  - Tailwind CSS and FontAwesome automatically loaded via CDN
  - NO build tools or npm required!
  - Responsive design for mobile, tablet and desktop
  - Modern HTML5 structure instead of outdated table layouts

  Optional:
  - In order to make thumbnails and reduced size images you need PHP compiled with
    the support for the GD library (http://www.boutell.com/gd) or the ImageMagick
    "convert" utility (http://www.imagemagick.org) or NetPBM (http://netpbm.sourceforge.net).


  ----------------------------------------------------------
  Installation:
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  (For updating from earlier versions see Update.english.txt)

  1. Decompress the .zip archive to a local directory on your system and FTP all
     the files it contains (being sure to retain the directory structure) to your host.
     Once all the files have been uploaded to your site you should point your browser
     at this location.

  2. Now, the Install-Screen comes up. Fill out the required fields and press
     "Start Installation".

  3. The installation script will create and populate all the necessary tables in
     your database and some basics settings.

  4. The Install-Script will then attempt to write to the config.php file which will
     contain the basic configuration data . If the installer cannot write config.php
     directly you will be given the option of downloading the file. You should then
     re-upload the file to your server, overwriting the existing config.php in the
     process.

  5. Set permissions for the following directories:

     chmod 777 (drwxrwxrwx) : data
     chmod 777 (drwxrwxrwx) : data/database
     chmod 777 (drwxrwxrwx) : data/media
     chmod 777 (drwxrwxrwx) : data/thumbnails
     chmod 777 (drwxrwxrwx) : data/tmp_media
     chmod 777 (drwxrwxrwx) : data/tmp_thumbnails

     IMPORTANT: templates/ directory does NOT require 777 permissions anymore!
     The modernized templates are not modified at runtime.

     You can do this with FTP programs such as Filezilla, CuteFTP or WS_FTP.

  6. You must ensure you remove "install.php" and any "update_*_to_*.php" files.
     Additionally you may delete all files in "data/database/default" if you wish.

  7. At this point your basic installation is complete. Please be sure to check the
     General Configuration details and make any required changes in your Control Panel.

  8. Since version 1.7.1, 4images has an internal caching system.
     Please read docs/Cache.english.txt for further informations.

     Since version 1.7.9, 4images includes an automatic protection against Cross-Site
     Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
     Please read docs/CSRF.english.txt for further informations.

     Since version 1.7.10 it is possible to define how the fields should be index
     for the search. The settings can be changed in includes/search_utils.php
     There are 3 types:

     "fulltext": Content will be split up by whitespaces. Words will be normalized and cleaned up.
     "keywords": Content will be split up by comma. Words will NOT be normalized and cleaned up.
     "phrase":   Content will NOT be split up. Words will NOT be normalized and cleaned up.

     The values can also be set in the config.php.
